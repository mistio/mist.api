class RuleState(me.EmbeddedDocument):
    """This class denotes the per resource state for a given Rule.

    A Rule's `states` field stores the current state of incidents that have
    been triggered. The majority of these incidents are meant to be active.

    The state of a given incident may be described by 3 timestamps:

        1. firing_since: denotes when the rule got triggered for a resource
        2. pending_since: denotes when the rule got in pending state
        3. resolved_since: denotes when the rule got untriggered

    A pending state describes an incident that has been triggered, because its
    query conditions evaluated to True, but the corresponding action/alert has
    been temporarily suppressed.

    A Rule's `states` field is supposed to keep state of unresolved incidents.
    However, untriggered/resolved incidents are also kept around for a small
    retention period in order to be propagated to the end user as "resolved".
    The retention period is specified by the `EXPIRE_PERIOD` class attribute.
    Resolved states older than `EXPIRE_PERIOD` seconds are removed.
