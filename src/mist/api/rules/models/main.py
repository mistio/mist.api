class Rule(me.Document):
    """The base Rule mongoengine model.

    The Rule class defines the base schema of all rule types. All documents of
    any Rule subclass will be stored in the same mongo collection.

    All Rule subclasses MUST define a `_controller_cls` class attribute and a
    backend plugin. Controllers are used to perform actions on instances of
    Rule, such as adding or updating. Backend plugins are used to transform a
    Rule into the corresponding query to be executed against a certain data
    storage. Different types of rules, such as a rule on monitoring metrics or
    a rule on logging data, should also define and utilize their respective
    backend plugins. For instance, a rule on monitoring data, which is stored
    in a TSDB like Graphite, will have to utilize a different plugin than a
    rule on logging data, stored in Elasticsearch, in order to successfully
    query the database.

    The Rule class is mainly divided into two categories:

    1. Arbitrary rules - defined entirely by the user. This type of rules gives
    users the freedom to execute arbitrary queries on arbitrary data. The query
    may include (nested) expressions and aggregations on arbitrary fields whose
    result will be evaluated against a threshold based on a comparison operator
    (=, <, etc).

    2. Resource rules - defined by using Mist.io UUIDs and tags. This type of
    rules can be used to easily setup alerts on resources given their tags or
    UUIDs. In this case, users have to explicitly specify the target metric's
    name, aggregation function, and resources either by their UUIDs or tags.
    This type of rules allows for easier alert configuration on known resources
    in the expense of less elastic query expressions.

    The Rule base class can be used to query the database and fetch documents
    created by any Rule subclass. However, in order to add new rules one must
    use one of the Rule subclasses, which represent different rule type, each
    associated with the corresponding backend plugin.
